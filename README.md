# Traffic-Monitoring-in-Bangladesh-3
Using traffic video feed data from Dhaka, Bangladesh, learners develop real-time object detection systems to identify and label vehicles, pedestrians, and other traffic elements. They work with pre-trained models and extend existing architectures to detect custom objects specific to urban traffic analysis, creating solutions that can monitor.
